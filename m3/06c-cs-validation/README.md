Following from Lab Sheet - 6C

When we perform form validation, we have to check on both the client side (using the browser-based JavaScript) and on the server side (in the Express).

Create your own HTML based on the following business logic for reporting lost and found


Logic

1. The user must enter the name of the item, and it must be more than 3 characters but less than 200 characters

2. Provides an email address that has at least a '@" character, a '.' character

3. Using radio buttons, the user can select whether they left the item in a taxi, bus or MRT. The user must select at least one

4. Using checkboxes, the user can select the various properties of the lost item, from the choices of "bulky", "expensive", "colorful", "branded", "small" and "plain". Only at most 3 checkboxes can be selected and at least one must be selected.

Challenge

For part 3, have a radio button that says "others". If the user clicks on that, they must then fill in another textbox to provide more details.
