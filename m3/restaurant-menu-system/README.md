Restaurant Menu System

Using the techniques learnt so far, create a suitable landing page for a Restaurant Menu system. This website allows the user to add a menu item into the system.

You will need to create the Express app yourself.

Note: This is just about user interface and template inheritance and does not need to have functional forms within.

Be sure to:
- enable support for static files (lab 3b)
- enable support for template inheritance (lab 4)

The website consists of those pages:
- A landing page that introduces the purpose of the website
- A page to let the user submit a new menu item
- A page for admins to manage menu items (perform CRUD functions)
- Using Bootstrap and Express, create a simple landing page consisting of a navbar that allows the user to navigate to different pages. Have a base template and use images placed in the public folder
